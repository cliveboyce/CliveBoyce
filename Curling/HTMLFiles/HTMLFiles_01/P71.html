This might well fit here: 18 Feb 1650. Indenture, being a marriage settlement between John Curling junior, yeoman, of Chilton in St. Laurence, Isle of Thanet, co. Kent and Elizabeth his wife of the one part and George Curling mariner of Ramsgate, in same isle and county concerning an annuity to be paid out of a messuage and land called Chilton in the parish of St. Laurence aforesaid in consideration of a marriage to be had between John son of the said John and Elizabeth and Jane Bassett, daughter of Thomas Bassett, baker, late of Ramsgate, deceased. Signature of John Curling junior. Mark of Elizabeth. Two seals. 30/-

<br/>Jane Bassett was baptised 4th October 1635 so would have been fifteen at the time of the indenture which fits in with it being a high status match. Poor girls married later at this time - a contrast to later periods when poverty and teenage marriage became linked. Jane Brett was a widow so presumably older and less fertile. That would suggest that most of the children I attributed to Jane in the spreadsheet johnkids.xls should be to Jane Bassett plus also George in 1653, with Thomas in the same year belonging to Jane Brett.
<br/>
<br/>Of great interest is George Curling. It would be reasonable to suppose he is John senior's brother, perhaps standing in because John senior is ill. John senior is not listed as a signatory to the indenture. I cannot think of any other reason for another man to be there. In 1638, George Curling, mariner, married Martha Witherden. They died in 1686 and 1682 respectively by which time he was listed as a gentleman. There is only one George Curling known to have been baptised between 1599 and 1630 and that was in 1617 which would fit but he was the son of George and Mary, his father also being a mariner.  None of them have any connection with Chilton whatsoever. 
<br/>
<br/>On the question of who was George in the marriage settlement: 
<br/>George son of Mathew baptised 29 Apr 1599 at St L who might be involved.
<br/>There are earlier baptisms: George son of Robert bap 25 Oct 1580 at St L and George son of George 21 dec 1589 which could also be the George in the indenture.
<br/>George Curling, fisherman, who married Mary Michell 1615 at St L and one of their children was George who married Martha Witherden see http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mtaylor/p53curlingmichell.htm
