We postulate that he is the father of John Curling who married Mercy Long. 
<br/>There is a marriage of John Curling of St Peter in Thanet, maltster, widower to Ann Curling widow of William Curling late of St Lawrence at St Alphege in Canterbury on 19 June 1662, Robert Maxted of St Lawrence afsd bonds (ex Canterbury Marriage Licences). The reference to Robert Maxted is perhaps significant as Ann Maxted was baptised in 1633 daughter of Robert Maxted and she had a brother Robert baptised in 1632. This suggests that Robert who underwrote the marriage bond for her second marriage was either her father or her brother (the father may have died about 1660). The transcript of the St Alphege parish register (page 80) has the bride's christian name missing and less detail. The Canterbury Cathedral Archives as on Findmypast seem to have only the transcript. Familysearch has the marriage of John Curling but not the bride's christian name.
<br/>
<br/>There appear to be three children from this marriage: Daniel 1663, Jane 1665 and John 1671. The baptism for John on 28 Dec 1671 fits with the birth year of John Curling who married Mercy Long.
<br/>We know that Ann Maxted married William Curling in 1651 and we know William died in April 1660 so it is very likely that she was the Ann Curling, widow of William Curling, who married John Curling in 1661.
<br/>
<br/>William Curling and Ann Maxted married in 1651 and had two daughters and a son:
<br/>	Elizabeth b 1653 
<br/>	Ann b 1654 
<br/>	John 1657 - 1665. 
<br/>
<br/>We know John was a widower when he married Ann in 1662.  John Curling’s first wife Mary died in 1659 (p 633 of St Peter’s register). William baptised 27 Dec in 1646 and Mary baptised 25 Sep 1653 p 570) at St Peter's with parents John and Mary Curling were likely to be his children.  
<br/>There is no marriage record about 1644 (fits with his birth after 1625) which would have taken place during the interregnum. However there are other Curling marriages at St Peters in this period.
