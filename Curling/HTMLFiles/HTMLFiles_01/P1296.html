<br/>
<br/>Richard Kemp dies and is buried at St. Lawrence on 19th January 1820 aged 83 (giving a birth date of 1737 + a couple of years), and is listed as being “of Ramsgate”. Hannah Kemp pre- deceases Richard and died and was buried on 24th April 1816 aged 75 at St. Lawrence, and is given as “of Ramsgate”, giving a birth date of approx. 1741. Hannah Boyman was christened 26th March 1741, d. of Stephen and Mary Boyman at St. Lawrence.
<br/>
<br/>Richard Kemp had previously married Mary Hooper (Bachelor & Spinster, both otp.) on 17th January 1765 at St. Lawrence.
<br/>They had a daughter Mary Kemp christened there 15th December 1765, who appears to be their only child.
<br/>Mary Kemp (the mother) dies and is buried on 17th September 1789 aged 60, given as “Wife of Richard” in the parish register.
<br/>This gives a birth date of approx. 1729 for Mary.
