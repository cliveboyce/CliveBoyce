' He the said Thomas Curling deceased at the same time laying his hand upon his Sister Sarah Curling then present) Whereupon the said Samuel Emes asked the
<br/>deceased if he meant the Legacys above mentioned given to his Sister to be his Sister the said Sarah Curling and her Children or to his other Sister to which the said deceased replyed Yes to this Sister (meaning the said Sarah Curling and her Children 
<br/>his sister Sarah and her children. No reference to his other siblings. On 13 Mar 1734 his mother Hester and next of kin was given power to "administer" the will as there was no executor. This was duly passed to Bridger Curling and Jane Hooper wife of Nicholas Hooper his natural and lawful only brother and sister. Why did he go on about his sister Sarah? Perhaps his sister in law. Thomas' sister Jane had a son Nicholas Hooper who married a Sarah.
<br/>
<br/>This rules out John b 1694 as a contender to marry Mary Kirby.</td></tr>
