<br/>
<br/>John Boyce married Grace Dunn by licence on 16 March 1857 at St Mary Major, Exeter. The marriage certificate gives John as of age, widower, watchmaker, residing at East Teignmouth, son of John Boyce watchmaker. John senior is not given as deceased. This establishes that there was a previous generation of watchmakers and fits with the establishment of the Boyce watch making business around 1798. Grace Dunn was given as of age, spinster, living at St Mary Major, Exeter, daughter of Richard Dunn, farmer (again not given as deceased). The witnesses were Thomas and Emma J Avent. The Avents are in the 1861 census living at South Street, St Mary Major, Exeter: Thomas Avent, aged 49, jeweller, and Emma J, his daughter, aged 24. John Boyce and Thomas Avent were obviously linked through the jewellery and clock trade.</a></tr></td>

<br/>		William Ward Boyce born October 17th 1836
<br/>		Ann Ward Boyce born March 15th 1838
<br/>		Harriet Boyce born November 21st 1840
<br/>		John Hawkings Boyce born November 20th1842
<br/>
<br/>Three deaths are also noted:
<br/>		Jane, the wife of John Boyce and the mother of these eight children died 27th January 1851. Aged 50 years
<br/>		John Hawkings Boyce died 14th October 1895
<br/>		Arthur Boyce died 14th October 1896.
<br/>
<br/>John must have moved the short distance from Cockington to Shaldon sometime between 1804 and 1829 as the 1851 census gives the birthplace of all children as St Nicholas (Shaldon).  He was certainly there in 1830 as he is given as watch and clock maker at Shaldon by Pigot in 1830 (William Ward , blockmaker is also recorded).
<br/>
<br/>1841 census, John Boyce, 37 (watchmaker), his wife Jane (40), and their children Sarah J (12), Edmund (10), Arthur (8), Maria (6), William (4) Ann W (2) and Harriett (6 months) are recorded at St Nicholas (Shaldon). In the same census for St Nicholas there is a Sarah Ward aged 35, housekeeper living with Sarah Boyce aged 12, which fits exactly with the Boyce bible. The entry immediately above Sarah Ward is William Ward aged 70, a blockmaker.  It is very unlikely that there were two Sarah Boyces aged 12 living in the same village and both associated with Sarah Ward. The most likely explanation is that they were counted twice.
<br/>
<br/>The family had moved to Teignmouth by 1842 as his youngest son John Hockings Boyce was born in Teignmouth that year. Pigot 1844 & White's Directory 1850 give John Boyce watch and clock maker at 2 Wellington Row, Teignmouth. 
<br/>1851 Census John and his children were living at 2,Wellington Row, Teignmouth. His eldest daughter Sarah aged 22 is described as his housekeeper; John's sons Edmund William John (20) and Arthur (18) are described as assistants in the trade.  The other children were Maria 16, William Ward 14, Ann Ward 13, Harriet 10 and John H, 8.
<br/>
<br/>There were no Boyces living in Shaldon in the 1851 Census but there were 3 other Boyce households in Teignmouth. 
<br/>
<br/>1857 Second marriage to Grace 
<br/>John Boyce married Grace Dunn by licence on 16 March 1857 at St Mary Major, Exeter. The marriage certificate gives John as of age, widower, watchmaker, residing at East Teignmouth, son of John Boyce watchmaker. John senior is not given as deceased. This establishes that there was a previous generation of watchmakers and fits with the establishment of the Boyce watch making business around 1798. Grace Dunn was given as of age, spinster, living at St Mary Major, Exeter, daughter of Richard Dunn, farmer (again not given as deceased). The witnesses were Thomas and Emma J Avent. The Avents are in the 1861 census living at South Street, St Mary Major, Exeter: Thomas Avent, aged 49, jeweller, and Emma J, his daughter, aged 24. John Boyce and Thomas Avent were obviously linked through the jewellry and clock trade.
<br/>
<br/>1861 Census John Boyce (John A) was still living at Wellington Street, East Teignmouth, (Street and Row seem to be interchangeable):
<br/>BOYCE, John, Head, married, age 56, Watch & Clockmaker, born Cockington
<br/>BOYCE, Grace, Wife, age 47, born Bow 
<br/>BOYCE, Maria, Daughter, unmarried, age 26, Milliner, born Shaldon
<br/>BOYCE, William, Son, unmarried, age 24, Watch & Clockmaker, born Shaldon
<br/>BOYCE, Ann, Daughter, unmarried, age 22 Dressmaker, born Shaldon
<br/>BOYCE, John Hawkings, Son, unmarried, age 18, Watch & Clockmaker, born East Teignmouth
<br/>Dwelling Place: Wellington Street.
<br/>
<br/>Sarah, Edmund and Arthur had left home and Harriet is not mentioned.
<br/>
<br/>Clock making was clearly in the blood for all four sons were in the trade. 
<br/>
<br/>1871 Census John and his second wife Grace were living at 2 Wellington Street, Teignmouth with John's son Arthur. 
<br/>
<br/>John Boyce died 19 Dec 1871 aged 67 having made his will in favour of his second wife Grace. He left under Â£100, ex Probate records . His death was registered Dec 1871 Newton Abbott 5b 97 and he was buried in Teignmouth cemetery.
<br/>
<br/>Some of the family remained at Wellington St until at least the late 1890s and at some stage the property was sold to the Extence family who are still in the antiques and clocks business but have sold 2 Wellington St.. I spoke to one of the family Leigh Extence who confirmed this  http://www.dervalantiques.com/about.htm
